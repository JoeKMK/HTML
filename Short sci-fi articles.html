    <h2> Singularity </h2> <!-- heading-->
   
    <hr>
    <p> Singularity is a hypothetical event in the future where technological progress have become so advanced
       and rapid that we won't be able to see past the event and technological growth becomes 
       uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. Singularity is
        popularized by renounced inventer and scientist Ray Kurzweil, who is also the head engineer of Google. </p>


        <p> Ray predicts that the advancement in computational power doubles every two year  following Moore's law and
          eventually it'll lead to technological singularity where we will have the technology to become immortal, eliminate
           aging and diseases, colonize the universe and create artificial intelligence that is smarter than us. </p> <!-- paragraph-->

        <h2> AI revolution and the Intelligence explosion from waitbutwhy.com</h2> <!-- heading-->
        <hr>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims
             to create it.The Intelligence explosion is rapid growth in the intelligence of machines and creation of the general 
                artificial intelligence. It's predicted to happen in the next 20 years. The present day AI is
                what we call narrow AI that is good at one thing. For example, AlphaGo is good at playing Go only.
                Another AI called Alphastar is another example of narrow AI. It is good at playing Starcraft 2
                to the grandmaster level and have beaten a few pro players already. However, it is still a narrow AI. </p>
                
                <p> 
             The intelligence explosion predicts that in the future, We'll be able to create general AI. General AI or AGI is AI that is good at 
             everything. There doesn't exist any AGI yet. However, when AGI arrives, it is predicted that it will surpass 
             the intelligence of all humanity combined. That is because AGI will be able to learn and improve itself
                infinitely. AGI will be able to create even more of smarter AGIs and the cycle will continue. This is called the intelligence
                explosion. That's when we'll have the ASI or Artificial Super Intelligence. ASI will be able to create
                 more ASIs which is smarter than itself. And ASI will be able to do everything better than humans and the humans will become obsolete. 
                 ASI will be Immortal, Smarter than all humans combined, do not suffer the biological comstraints that humans have.
                 Eventually, the intelligence of the ASI will be so advanced that humans won't be able to understand it and
                  we'll be at the whim of the ASI. If the ASI is benevolent, it will be good for us. However, if the ASI is bad,
                   then it will be bad for us.
