        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web). Web development can range from 
            developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (web apps), online businesses
             and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering,
              Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
               and e-commerce development.</p> 
        
        <p> Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup language and 
            coding. Most recently, Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from
             scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser.
              A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their Web site without having technical
               knowledge.</p>
